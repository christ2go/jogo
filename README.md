###  JOGO 
JOGO is a logo interpreter written in JavaScript. It currently is still under development.

## Features

*   Variables
*   Nearly all built-in Logo procedures
*   Ability to define your own procedures

Many things already work.
It is still under development, so Infixparsing and recursion don't really work at the moment, but these should be fixed within the next weeks.

**Current Version: 0.0.1**
(Yeah, a lot of zeros)

##  TODO 

*   Arrays (not supposed to be implemented)
*   Saving your procedures for later
*   Make word functions return arrays
*   Ability to add JavaScript functions
## Changelog
* 15th December 2014 Version 0.0.1 (Recursion)
Released unter GPL.
